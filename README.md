# CellMotility
Repository for cell motility code. 

To run simulations, download the code and run
RunAllMech1 (for mechanism 1) OR
RunAllMech2 (for mechanism 2). 
This will run a set of 8 simulations for each regime for each mechanism
(total of 32 simulations per mechanism). 
Number of simulations can be changed directly in these files.
